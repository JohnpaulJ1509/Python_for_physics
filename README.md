# Python for physics
This is a platform that will provide a number of programs which will be useful to understand the basics of computation in physics. 
Python will the most used programming language in this platform.
This will also give a better underatanding of physical models and bacic numerical problems in physics and other branches of science.
The ablity to understand the concepts is an important part in learning. This (coding) will be one of the way which will give one a better understading of the things that they learn.
